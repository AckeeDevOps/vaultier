# Vaultier: CI/CD Vault helper

Vaultier will be simple helper for Container native CI/CD pipelines. 
The main goal is to parse specs file, obtain secrets from the Vault 
instance and create basic (one level deep) JSON file for the further 
processing by dotenv-like libraries or Helm.

Currently it's under heavy deployment, stay tuned :)
